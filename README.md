Want to have an immersive experience as a cop? Try out this police dashcam for free! The visual interface is based on the dash cam used by the Dutch police, but I also added the option to use an English translation. You could of course, also add your own translation if you wish.

## Features:
- Enter the dash cam via a configurable key-bind, the co-driver can also use the dash cam if this is enabled in the config.
- An average speed measurement can be started through a configurable key-bind.
- The date and time are displayed, some extra text-fields are also editable to your own liking.
- Any vehicle added to the configuration will have the dash cam installed, the position of the dash-cam is also configurable.
- It is possible to add a job requirement when using the dash cam.

You can of course also implement your own features (for private use). The job-check is only implemented for ESX, if you are using a different framework you will have to change this line accordingly.
